# QGIS-BiobasedPET

IMAGE

This repository contains data from the optimization model of the biobased PET supply chains using different midpoint impact categories (*global warming potential - GWP, human toxicity potential - HTP, fossil depletion potential - FDP, and agriculture land occupation potential - ALOP*). 

For more information of the optimization model, please refer to LINK PUBLICATION. 

## Included files

**Supply chain nodes layers** - These shapefiles include details of the different suppliers (biomass) and entities (bioethanol, ethylene, etc) of the supply chain such as plant ID, geographical location, company, total capacity).

**Supply chain network layers** - These CSV data files contain the information of the origin and destination of the mass flows between supplier/entities. Additionally, the amount of mass transported between nodes is included in tonne/year.
